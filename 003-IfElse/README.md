# If-Else
In this challenge, we test your knowledge of using [if-else conditional statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)) to automate decision-making processes.

**Task**<br>
Given an integer *n* perform the following conditional actions:

- If *n* is odd, print `Weird`
- If *n* is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 print `Not Weird`
- If *n* is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 print `Weird`
- If *n* is even and greater than 20 print `Not Weird`

Print whether or not *n* is weird.

**Input Format**<br>
A single line containing a positive integer *n*.

**Constraints**<br>
- 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 100

**Output Format**<br>
Print `Weird` if the number is weird otherwise print `Not Weird`.

**Sample Input 1**<br>
```

**Sample Output 1**<br>
```
Weird
```

**Sample Input 2**<br>
```

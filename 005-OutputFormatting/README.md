# Output Formatting
The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output.

**Input Format**<br>
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.

**Output Format**<br>
In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
The second column contains the integer expressed in exactly 3 digits. If the original input has less than three digits you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.

**Sample Input**<br>
```
java 100
cpp 65
python 50
```

**Sample Output**<br>
```
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
```
